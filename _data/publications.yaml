    abstract: > State of the art large language models rely on randomization to respond to a prompt. As an
immediate consequence, a model may respond differently to the same prompt if asked multiple times.
In this work, we argue that the evaluation and ranking of large language models should control for the
randomization underpinning their functioning. Our starting point is the development of a causal model
for coupled autoregressive generation, which allows different large language models to sample responses
with the same source of randomness. Building upon our causal model, we first show that, on evaluations
based on benchmark datasets, coupled autoregressive generation leads to the same conclusions as vanilla
autoregressive generation but using provably fewer samples. However, we further show that, on evaluations
based on (human) pairwise comparisons, coupled and vanilla autoregressive generation can surprisingly
lead to different rankings when comparing more than two models, even with an infinite amount of samples.
This suggests that the apparent advantage of a model over others in existing evaluation protocols may not
be genuine but rather confounded by the randomness inherent to the generation process. To illustrate and
complement our theoretical results, we conduct experiments with several large language models from the
Llama family. We find that, across multiple knowledge areas from the popular MMLU benchmark dataset,
coupled autoregressive generation requires up to 40% fewer samples to reach the same conclusions as
vanilla autoregressive generation. Further, using data from the LMSYS Chatbot Arena platform, we find
that the win-rates derived from pairwise comparisons by a strong large language model to prompts differ
under coupled and vanilla autoregressive generation.
